# CMakeIt - a collection of CMake modules to build programs from 'Visual Studio'-like 
# projects, and well-structure project layouts (public and private include folders,
# source folders), using CMake build system. Also features pre compiled headers
# support, unit tests, installation ('make install' style), packaging, etc.
